This is Jinzhe Shan's project about COM90049-KT Assignment 1 2019 S2 at Unimelb.

This project aims to detect blend word from the candidates.txt.

---------------Files Description------------------------------
There are four main .py documents in this project.

01blendMining.py
It aims to mine features and patterns about blend words using blends.txt

02removeAlgorithm.py
It is used to preprocess candidates.txt and dict.txt to remove some candidate words because they are impossible as actual blend words

03blend-words-detection-Final-Version.py
This is the core python file which implements the blend word detection algorithm.

04Calculate_Precision&Recall.py
it is used to calculate the precision and recall value for evaluating the performence of this detection algorithm.

---------------How to use them------------------------------

1. Import the project to PyCharm or other IED you like 

2. Run blendMining.py, you will see all data mining results of blends.txt

3. Run removeAlgorithm.py, you can get a smaller dataset, which will speed up the efficiency of this algorithm

4. Run the blend-words-detection-Final-Version.py
